            <p>Draft of Frankenstein, [August or September] – [?December] 1816. | Bodleian MS. 
               Abinger c.56 (formerly designated Dep. 477/1) consists of 62 leaves originally 
               bound in Notebook A, one of two now disbound notebooks in which Mary W. Shelley 
               (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of Frankenstein. The draft in c.56 runs 
               from the beginning to the end of Volume I, concluding just as the Creature is 
               about to begin his tale to Victor.</p>

            "now I hope."<lb/>
            I trembled excessively: I could not<lb/>

            and we soon arrived at my colledge.<lb/>
            I then reflected–and the thought made<lb/>
            me shiver that the creature whom<lb/>
            I had left in my appartment might<lb/>
            be still there—alive and walking<lb/>
            about. I dreaded to see him but I<lb/>

            my own room. My hand was already<lb/>
            on the lock before I recovered<lb/>

            nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully<lb/>
